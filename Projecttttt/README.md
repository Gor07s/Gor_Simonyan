# Welcome to Easy Sender!

Now I will briefly introduce this site, what it is for and how to work with it.

### What is Easy Sender?

Easy Sender is a site with which you can easily create a template and send letters.

### Difference between regular templates and Easy Sender templates.

Let's admit this case. You have created a congratulations template with a name and so on. Each time the template is used, the name will be static. And thus, if there are many such words, you will have to find and change them all manually.
Easy Sender provides templates with dynamic words. that is, if the word changes with every sending, you can declare it dynamic, after which there is a field in which you just need to put the word, and it will automatically fall into place.
this is especially convenient for those who work a lot with the same type of templates.

### Work with Easy Sender.

There are 3 main tabs on the site:

* Add template
* Use template
* Send without template

##### Add Template

The templates themselves are added here. Just fill in a couple of fields and in the Text field where a dynamic word is needed, just write this word in brackets {_}:

Example: Hello {name}!

Now the word "name" is dynamic, everything is very simple!

Then press "add" and you're done!

##### Use Template

In this tab we will use, modify and delete templates.

When you add a template, you can use it, delete or modify it. Just click on "my templates" on the left and all your templates will appear. Click on one of them and a short description of this template will appear and at the bottom there will be 3 buttons: use, modify and delete.

###### Use

Use a template, just fill in the fields.

If you want to make a dynamic word individual for each recipient, then use the checkbox opposite. Then there will be as many fields as there are recipients.

###### Modify

You can change the template you create.

###### Delete

Just remove the template if you no longer need it.


##### Send without template.

If you just need to send an email without a template, then this is the tab for you.

This was a short description of this site.
